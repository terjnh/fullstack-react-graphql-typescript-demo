Some information on how redis stores / retrieves cookies

// store user id session - this will set a cookie on the user
//  - keep them logged in
From user.ts:
- req.session.userId = user.id;
    - Storing some data into session

    - {userId: 1} -> send that to redis
    - Step 1 ... sess:<someKey> -> {userId: 1}
    - Then, if i give redis <someKey>, it will return me { userId: 1 }

    - Step 2 ... express-session will set a cookie on my browser <some-cookie-value>
    - <some-cookie-value> is a signed-version of <someKey>

    - Step 3 ... When user makes a request,
    - <some-cookie-value> is sent -> to the server

    - Step 4 ... Server will unsign <some-cookie-value>
    - it will use 'secret' from RedisStore (index.ts) to unsign it.
    - after unsigning <some-cookie-value> ---> sess:<someKey> (decryption)

    - Step 5 ... Make a request to redis
    - sess:<someKey>
